# How Everything Works

## The User Journey

1. User goes to `faq.intelligentresources.app` → enters competitor URLs + their email → submits
2. The form POSTs to the n8n webhook
3. ~2–5 mins later they get an email with a CSV of competitor FAQs attached

## n8n Workflow (`tBiQRf6dFVhD2DvN`)

```
Webhook → Prepare Variables → Start Scrape Job (POST /scrape)
  → Wait 10s → Poll Result (GET /result/{job_id})
  → Still Processing? ──yes──→ Wait 10s (loops)
                      ──no──→ FAQs Found?
                                ──yes──→ Decode CSV → Send Report (Gmail)
                                ──no──→ Send No-Data Email (Gmail)
```

## Coolify Server (`api.py`) — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Receive the request

`POST /scrape` is called with `{ "urls": "https://example.com" }`.
The server creates a **job ID** (UUID), stores it as `status: processing`, fires the work off in a background thread, and immediately returns `{ job_id }` to n8n. This avoids Cloudflare's 100-second timeout.

---

### Step 2 — Parse the submitted URLs

The raw `urls` string is split on commas and newlines. Each item is trimmed and validated — only strings starting with `http` are kept. Multiple URLs can be submitted in one job (one per competitor).

---

### Step 3 — URL Discovery (per domain)

For each submitted URL, the scraper derives the **base domain** (e.g. `https://www.simprogroup.com`) and runs discovery to find the best pages to scrape.

#### 3a. Firecrawl Map

Firecrawl crawls the entire site by following all `<a>` links recursively, up to **500 URLs** for the main domain. Returns a flat list of every URL it found.

- `include_subdomains=True` is set so it also finds URLs on subdomains like `helpguide.simprogroup.com`, `docs.example.com`, `support.example.com`.

#### 3b. Help subdomain detection

From the full URL list, the scraper looks for any subdomain whose prefix matches a known help keyword: `help`, `helpguide`, `support`, `docs`, `documentation`, `kb`, `faq`, `faqs`, `knowledge`.

If found (e.g. `helpguide.simprogroup.com`), a **separate Firecrawl map** is run on that subdomain alone (up to **300 URLs**) to get its full page list.

#### 3c. MadCap Flare fallback

Some help sites (like Simpro's `helpguide.simprogroup.com`) are built with **MadCap Flare** — a documentation platform that has an empty `<body>` and loads all navigation via JavaScript. Firecrawl map can only find ~1 page on these sites because there are no `<a>` links to follow.

When a help subdomain returns fewer than 20 URLs from Firecrawl, the scraper tries the MadCap Flare route:
1. Fetch `/Data/HelpSystem.js` — this file references the table of contents
2. Parse out the TOC file path (e.g. `Data/Tocs/Phase_5.js`)
3. Fetch the TOC file — it references chunk files (`Phase_5_Chunk0.js`, `Phase_5_Chunk1.js`, etc.)
4. Fetch each chunk — these are JavaScript objects containing every page URL and title on the site
5. Extract all `.htm` paths from the chunks and prepend the base URL

This is how all 10 FAQ pages on `helpguide.simprogroup.com` are found (out of 767 total pages).

#### 3d. Sitemap fallback

If Firecrawl fails entirely (API error, key missing), the scraper falls back to parsing the site's XML sitemap:
1. Fetch `robots.txt` — look for `Sitemap:` directives
2. Try `/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap_index.xml`
3. Follow any sub-sitemap references (skipping image/video/news sitemaps)

#### 3e. Common path probing

If no FAQ or help pages were found from any of the above, the scraper does a series of `HEAD` requests to common paths:
`/faq`, `/faqs`, `/frequently-asked-questions`, `/help`, `/support`, `/help-center`, `/helpdesk`, `/knowledge-base`

Any path that returns a non-404 response is added to the list.

---

### Step 4 — Categorise every discovered URL

Each URL is categorised into one of five types:

| Category | How it's detected | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| `faq` | Path contains `faq`, `faqs`, or `frequently-asked` | `/resources/faq`, `/support/faqs` |
| `help` | Path contains `help`, `support`, `docs`, `kb`, `knowledge-base`, etc. | `/help-center`, `/docs` |
| `home` | Root path only (no segments) | `example.com/` |
| `article_index` | Path has a blog keyword (`blog`, `articles`, `resources`, `guides`, etc.) with no post slug after it | `/blog`, `/resources/guides` |
| `article_post` | Path has a blog keyword followed by a **slug** | `/blog/how-to-manage-field-service` |

**How slugs are detected:** a path segment is treated as a post slug (not a category) if it has **2 or more hyphens** OR is **longer than 20 characters**.
Examples:
- `/blog/case-studies` → `case-studies` has 1 hyphen → **article_index** (category page)
- `/blog/service-reminder-email` → 2 hyphens → **article_post** (post)
- `/blog/how-to-manage-field-service` → 4 hyphens → **article_post** (post)
- `/resources/webinars/mastering-growth` → 2 segments after `resources` → **article_post**

---

### Step 5 — Select pages to scrape

Pages are selected in strict priority order, up to a maximum of **12 pages per domain**:

| Priority | Type | Max |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1st | Dedicated FAQ pages | 3 |
| 2nd | Help/support pages | 1 |
| 3rd | Homepage | 1 |
| 4th | Blog/content index pages | 2 |
| 5th | Individual blog/article posts | 5 |

If the user submitted a specific FAQ or help URL (e.g. `https://aroflo.com/resources/faq`), that URL is always included first regardless of discovery.

---

### Step 6 — Fetch each page

Each selected URL is fetched via **Firecrawl scrape**, which renders JavaScript and returns the page content. Two formats are requested simultaneously:

- **Markdown** — Firecrawl's cleaned, structured version of the page content
- **rawHtml** — the full rendered HTML including all DOM elements

The rawHtml is parsed with **BeautifulSoup**, which extracts all text including **CSS-hidden elements** (e.g. Webflow accordion answers hidden with `display:none` — this is why Aroflo's FAQ answers were missing).

Whichever result is **longer** (markdown vs rawHtml text) is used. This ensures accordion/collapsed content is always captured.

Content is capped at **60,000 characters** before being sent to the LLM.

If Firecrawl fails for a page, it falls back to a plain HTTP request + BeautifulSoup.

Pages shorter than **100 characters** after fetching are skipped.

---

### Step 7 — Extract FAQs with the LLM

The page text is sent to **Claude Haiku 4.5** via OpenRouter with a prompt that instructs it to:

- For **dedicated FAQ pages**: extract every Q&A pair found
- For **blog posts**: only extract content from explicit FAQ sections (e.g. a heading that says "FAQs" or "Frequently Asked Questions"). If no FAQ section exists, return `[]`
- Return only valid JSON: `[{"question": "...", "answer": "..."}, ...]`
- Keep answers under 500 characters
- No markdown fencing, no explanation — just the JSON

If the LLM returns non-JSON or an empty array, zero FAQs are added for that page.

---

### Step 8 — Deduplicate

Within a single job, exact duplicate questions (same text) are dropped. This prevents the same Q&A appearing twice if it appears on multiple pages of the same site.

---

### Step 9 — Build the CSV and return

All collected rows are written into a CSV with columns:
`Competitor | Source URL | Question | Answer | Date`

The CSV is **base64-encoded** and returned in the job result:
```json
{
  "status": "done",
  "found": true,
  "count": 42,
  "csv": "<base64 string>",
  "pages_checked": ["https://...", "https://..."]
}
```

If zero FAQs were found across all pages:
```json
{
  "status": "done",
  "found": false,
  "message": "We couldn't find any FAQ content..."
}
```

---

### Step 10 — n8n decodes and emails

Back in n8n:
- **Decode CSV** node: base64-decodes the CSV string into a binary file attachment
- **Send Report** node: sends a Gmail with the CSV attached to the user's email
- **Send No-Data Email** node: sends a Gmail explaining no FAQ content was found and suggests trying a direct FAQ/help URL

## Limits & Constraints

### Per submission
| What | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Pages scraped per domain | Max **12 pages** |
| FAQ/help pages per domain | Max **3** |
| Blog index pages per domain | Max **2** |
| Individual blog/article posts | Max **5** (LLM skips if no FAQ section) |
| Page content sent to LLM | Max **60,000 chars** per page |
| Deduplication | Exact duplicate questions within the same job are dropped |

### URL discovery
| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Normal site | Firecrawl crawls up to 500 URLs via `<a>` links |
| Help/docs subdomain detected | Separate Firecrawl map on that subdomain (up to 300 URLs) |
| MadCap Flare help site | TOC chunk files read directly — bypasses JS-only navigation |
| Sitemap available | Used as fallback if Firecrawl fails |
| No FAQ/help pages found | Falls back to probing common paths (`/faq`, `/help`, `/support`, etc.) |
| Firecrawl fails entirely | Falls back to plain HTTP + BeautifulSoup |

### Content extraction
| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Normal page | Firecrawl Markdown (clean, structured) |
| Accordion / collapsed answers (CSS `display:none`) | rawHtml parsed by BeautifulSoup — includes hidden elements |
| JavaScript-rendered page | Firecrawl renders JS before extracting |
| Page under 100 chars after fetch | Skipped |

### What gets skipped
- Blog/article posts beyond the 5-post limit
- Pages shorter than 100 characters after fetching
- Duplicate questions within the same job run
- URLs that aren't on the same root domain as the submitted URL

### Known edge cases
- **Dynamically loaded FAQ content** (answers fetched via API on click, not in the DOM) — answers will be missing or empty
- **Login-gated pages** — will return empty or an error page
- **Very large sites** — Firecrawl map is capped at 500 URLs for the main domain and 300 for subdomains; pages beyond that won't be discovered
- **Rate limiting / bot protection** — some sites block scrapers; these will return empty content
- **MadCap Flare** — fully supported via TOC parsing. Other JS-heavy help platforms (Zendesk Guide, Intercom Articles) may have limited discovery

### Timing
- Each page takes roughly **15–30 seconds** to fetch + extract
- A full domain (12 pages max) takes roughly **3–6 minutes**
- The n8n polling loop checks every **10 seconds**
- No hard timeout — the job runs until complete or errors
